I recently graduated from CUHK(SZ) and obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering in 2023. I am going to pursue a Master's degree in Software Engineering at CMU-Silicon Valley.

I am interested in video game-related fields and currently work as Game AI Development Engineer (Intern) for AI Lab @ NetEase Games. Last summer (2022), I interned at [HyperGryph (鹰角网络)](https://www.hypergryph.com/) and worked as Game Client Engineer for their popular mobile game project, [*Arknights (明日方舟)*](https://ak.hypergryph.com/). During my undergraduate, I worked in [Human-Crypto Society Laboratory](https://hcslab.cuhk.edu.cn/) (originally *Human-Cloud Systems Laboratory*) as a research assistant for around two years, where I focused on Video Games, Web3 & Blockchain and developed the [*CUHKSZ Metaverse*](https://hcslab.cuhk.edu.cn/cuhkszmetaverse-eng/) system with other members.
